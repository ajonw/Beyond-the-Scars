  - 'Self Attachment is a form of mental health therapy that aims to help individuals
    excel themselves. '
  - The game consists of different Self-Attachment exercises or protocols that will
    be administered to you in an interactive and fun manner.
  - These protocols simulate a parent-child relationship between you and your childhood
    self.
  - The aim of these exercises is to help you build secure attachment with your childhood-self.
  - You as your "adult" self will learn how a good parent interacts with a child
    through role playing.
  - Sorry to ask again, but was that clear?  or do you need me to repeat?
