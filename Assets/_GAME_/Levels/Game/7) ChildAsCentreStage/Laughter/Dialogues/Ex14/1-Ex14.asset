  dialogue:
  - Exercise 14 is about performing intentional laughter
  - At a time when you are alone, open your mouth slightly, loosen your face muscles,
    raise your eyebrows,
  - Then invite your child to slowly and continuously repeat one of the following
    tones, each of which uses a minimum amount of energy
  - eh, eh, eh, eh; or ah, ah, ah, ah; or oh, oh, oh, oh; or uh, uh, uh, uh; or ye,
    ye, ye, ye
  - If you need a subject to laugh at, you can laugh at the silliness of the exercise
  - Once this continuous intentional laughter becomes a habit, your child would be
    able to shape it according to your personality and style to create your own brand
    of laughter.
