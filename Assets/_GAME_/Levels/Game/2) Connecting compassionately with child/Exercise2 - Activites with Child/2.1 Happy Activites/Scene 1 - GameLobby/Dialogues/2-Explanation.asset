  dialogue:
  - The goal of this session, is for you to build a compassionate connection and
    affectional bond with your child-self.
  - To do this, first you will select a jolly lyrical song you cherish that invokes
    feelings of warmth, affection, love.
  - Then I want you to image as if you are dancing with your child-self, acting like
    a loving parent.
  - Are you ready to start or do you need me to repeat that?
