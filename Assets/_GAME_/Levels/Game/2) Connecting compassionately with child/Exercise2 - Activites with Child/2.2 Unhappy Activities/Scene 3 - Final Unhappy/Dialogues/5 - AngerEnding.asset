  dialogue:
  - Now that you are calmer, I am sure you can think more clearly
  - There is no use in revenge, it will just bring more pain in your life and those
    around you.
  - You need to forgive your parents and let go of it all
  - Do it for the sake of your future family and friends who will love and care for
    you
  - You are right, thank you so much for the advice.
