  dialogue:
  - Now that you have learned to change you perspective let's move on to exercise
    16 which is split into two parts
  - Exercise 16 focuses on learning to be playful about your past pains
  - In the first part, exercise 16a, try to visualise a painful event that took place
    in the recent past that you have struggled with
  - An example would be a traumatic childhood experience you had when you were younger
  - 'Despite its painfulness, try to see a positive

    impact it has had for you.'
  - Maybe it had taught you a valuable lesson in becoming a stronger person or motivated
    you to become a better parent
  - Use any of the theories for humour and invite your child to be playful about
    it and try to laugh at the event.
  - Next for exercise 16b, try to repeat for a childhood pain you have endured for
    a long time.
  - Take as much time as you require and when you are ready to move on, continue
    with the dialogue
