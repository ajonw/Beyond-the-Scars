  dialogue:
  - When you are deeply stuck in patterns of negative emotion, it is like staring
    at the black vase, full of dark and negative emotions.
  - The more you stare at it, the more you get drowned in its negativity. It is like
    seeing a glass half-empty instead of half-full.
  - However, with some recently learned mental flexibility, your attention can now
    be switched away from seeing the black vase to the two white faces.
  - As part of this exercise, stare at the black vase and laugh for one minute the
    moment your perception changes and you see two white faces, conceived as Adult
    and Child, looking at each other
  - Stare at the two white faces and laugh for one minute the moment your perception
    changes and you see the black vase
  - Take ur time to do this and when you are ready to move on continue the dialogue
