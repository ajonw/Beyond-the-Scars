  dialogue:
  - Well done on making it this far
  - In the previous exercise, we managed to build a compassionate bond to our childhood
    self
  - We did this by recalling childhood memories and learning to have compassion for
    our child regardless of their emotions
  - In this section our aim is to form a loving relationship with our childhood self
  - We do this to create an emotional connection mirroring that which a goodparent
    has for their children.
  - Let's begin with the exercises!
