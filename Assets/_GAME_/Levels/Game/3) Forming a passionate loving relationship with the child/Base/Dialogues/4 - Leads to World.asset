  dialogue:
  - Now that you have completed the pledge, let's move on to the next exercise
  - Having made the pledge, we will now restore our emotional world
  - We do this by representing our emotional world as a home with derelict parts
    that you will fully renovate.
  - "The new home is intended to provide a safe haven at times of distress for the
    child and a safe base for the child to tackle life\u2019s challenges"
  - The new home and its garden is bright and sunny. We will carry out the remaining
    self-attachment exercises in this environment.
  - There is however, the unrestored basement of the new house which represents the
    remnant of the derelict house and contains our negative emotions.
  - When suffering negative emotions, imagine that the child is trapped in the basement
    but can gradually learn to open the door of the basement, walk out and enter
    the bright rooms, reuniting with the adult.
