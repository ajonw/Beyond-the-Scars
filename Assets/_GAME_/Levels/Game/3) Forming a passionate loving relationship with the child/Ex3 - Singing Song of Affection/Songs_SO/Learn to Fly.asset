  lyrics:
  - 
  - A sticky summers' day in Shepherdstown
  - An eagle in a thermal is a' circlin' round
  - Like a tire on a bike rolling down Columbus Street
  - Katie got a little look of hope in her eye
  - Arms unfold as she looked to the sky
  - and said, "I'm going to learn to fly around with you"
  - She jumped up high and she fell to the ground
  - Skinned her little knee and made a horrible sound
  - She got right up and she tried again
  - Smiling all the way with her unstoppable grin
  - Take time, do what you're going to do
  - Just smile, you're gonna see it through
  - Your wings are going to spread and lift you off the ground
  - Take time, do what you're going to do
  - Just smile, you're gonna see it through
  - Your wings are going to sprout and you will learn to fly
  - All the other children used to laugh at her
  - They say your head is in the clouds and when you come back to earth
  - That the men in the white coats, they will all be waiting for you
  - But Katie knew that there was something they didn't see
  - She climbed up to the top of the sycamore tree
  - and said, "look out world, I'm going to fly away"
  - She stood so tall and with all her might
  - She took a flying leap of an astonishing height
  - A wind blew through and it carried her high
  - and Katie knew that she was just beginning to fly
  - Take time, do what you're going to do
  - Just smile, you're gonna see it through
  - Your wings are going to spread and lift you off the ground
