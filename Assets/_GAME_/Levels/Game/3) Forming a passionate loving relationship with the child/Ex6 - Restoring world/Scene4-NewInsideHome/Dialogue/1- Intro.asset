  dialogue:
  - Wow! Our home is so much better now
  - Yes indeed, we managed to transform this place together
  - This represents our emotional world that we have transformed
  - The basement however remains as is
  - It is a representation of our negative emotions
  - 'Whenever you are under negative emotions and trapped in the basement, remember
    what I said and push yourself to escape '
  - I will always be here waiting for you
  - For now enjoy your time here, I will have to get out of the house.
  - Thank you so much for everything
