  dialogue:
  - Exercise 10 is about updating our rigid beliefs to enhance creativity
  - Challenge your usual ideological framework to weaken any one-sided belief patterns
    and encourage spontaneity and examination of any issue from multiple perspectives
  - Practice this with subjects or themes that you have deep-rooted beliefs about
    and you are also interested in.
  - This may include any social, political, or ethical issue, such as marriage, sexual
    orientation or racism.
  - For example, whatever your political viewpoint on a specific subject is, consider
    the subject both from a liberal and conservative point of view
  - Or from a left-wing and right-wing point of view and try to understand both sides
    of the issue and challenge your dominant ideological framework.
  - "This does not mean that you would change your viewpoint but it allows you to
    see the subject from different perspectives and to be able to put yourself in
    other people\u2019s shoes."
  - Consider a different question or issue daily for at least 5 minutes.
  - Take your time and let me know if you are ready to move on
