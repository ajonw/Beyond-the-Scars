  dialogue:
  - Great job on completing the whole Self Attachment Therapy
  - I hope you have found great use for it in overcoming you childhood trauma and
    breaking the cycle of violence
  - After this, you will be placed in a scenario as your adult self, which you must
    navigate through using what you have learned in the SAT treatment
  - Aim to break the cycle of violence and not repeat your negative and traumatic
    childhood experience
  - Good luck!!!
