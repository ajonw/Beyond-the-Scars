  dialogue:
  - In exercise 19, our goal is to finding and bonding with your compassionate role
    model
  - Look in your past life for a compassionate figure who impressed you by being
    kind and helpful with some words of wisdom when you had problems.
  - 'For example, an older relative or friend, family acquaintance, teacher,

    counsellor
    or therapist who may have passed away or may not be contactable.'
  - Remember the emotions you went through when you received kindness and compassion
    form this figure and how emotional this was for you
  - Focus your attention and adopt this figure as your idealised role model.
  - Create a platonic loving bond with this figure by singing aloud your favourite
    love song when remembering all your cherished memories of them.
  - "One particular song you may try is \u201CI cannot help falling in love with
    you\u201D."
  - Take your time on listening to the song.
  - Are you ready to move on?
