  dialogue:
  - For exercise 18, we aim to better plan more constructive actions
  - Work out a new way to handle, in the future, what you have identified as acting
    out anti-social feelings or bearing personal resentment in your life
  - Without denying these feelings, try to reflect and contain them and avoid acting
    them out. Try to let go of the personal resentment
  - This may be hard and challenging but it is necessary for emotional growth. Here,
    you are taking a critical but constructive stance towards your Child and are
    exercising foresighted compassion.
  - Find a positive way of re-channeling the aggressive energy invoked by these feelings
    to productive work like going for some exercise or talking to a friend and ultimately
    to creative work towards your noble goal in life
  - Again please take your time
  - Are you ready to move on?
