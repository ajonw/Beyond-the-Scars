  dialogue:
  - Are you kidding me? I just walked in after a 10-hour day, and there's not even
    a meal on the table? What have you been doing all day!?
  - "Kai, I\u2019ve been working too, you know. I didn\u2019t have time to cook.
    I figured we could just order something."
  - Order something? Seriously? We can't just keep throwing money away on takeout
    every night! It's not that hard to throw something together before I get home
  - "Not that hard? You think I\u2019ve been sitting around all day? I\u2019m just
    as tired as you are, Kai. And it's not fair to expect me to handle everything
    after work too"
  - Oh, so now I'm the bad guy for wanting a decent
  - Whatever, I guess I will be starving myself to bed tonight
  - Sorry about that Kai, but please stop this, not infront of our daughter
  - Jane, go and get you Dad some water
  - Yes mother
