  - 'The game will first take you back to your childhood, where you will be exposed
    to an abusive household environment. '
  - Along the way, I will pop up to provide you with Self-Attachment Technique exercises.

    dealing with a hostile and abusive environment.
  - Sorry to ask again, but was that clear?  or do you need me to repeat?
